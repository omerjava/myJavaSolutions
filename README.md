# mySolutionsToSimpleJavaChallenges

- You can find in this repository my Java solutions to simple code challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard).
- I wrote a Java method to find a solution and called the method in main method of a class to see the result.
- You can find `.java` files under `src` folder to check codes.
- The solutions I shared here passed the tests in [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard).
- They can be refactored sure!
